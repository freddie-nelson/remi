     * ! For adding uvs to mesh:
     * ! First need to implement function to get aabb of mesh's vertices, only recalculate when raw vertices change, don't even need to worry about indices since they won't affect the aabb
     * ! Need to either pass aabb to shader to have uvs calculated in shader, or calculate uvs in c++ and pass to shader
     * ! Need to add ability for user to set custom uvs for the mesh, but use calculated uvs by default, number of uvs should be equal to number of vertices
     * ! uvs are in range [0, 1] and represent the percentage of the texture to use, so (0, 0) is the bottom left of the texture and (1, 1) is the top right of the texture
     * ! maybe add ability to scale aabb used for calculating uvs, so that the user can scale the uvs i.e. the texture on the mesh
